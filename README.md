# Stocks

This is a simple stock security tracker. I am working on it to help me understand the analysis associated with trading stocks, since I have no training and no clue how such analysis actually works. This is not intended to be guidance for trading stocks, or anything else, and will almost certainly lead to wrong choices if someone tries to use it for some purpose or other. 

This application will be a simple stock tracker that is able to do past analysis on the history of specific stocks. Several types of analysis is planned such as:
* Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
* Fibonacci
* Bollinger
* Breath Thrust Indicator (BTI)
* SMA and EMA and others
* Other indicator generators.

After that is working sufficiently well, then implement the logic needed to select a set of indicators and track how it would have done in the past if we had used it. 

One of my chief resources is [here](https://www.investopedia.com/). This site has a lot of information for abject noobs like me. Most of the math that is implemented in this application was gotten from here.

This program will be implemented using Python3, Tkinter, and SQlite. There should be no other dependencies and most modern operating environemnts should be supported. There is no plan to directly support iPad or Android. 

Questions and bugs can be submitted through github.
