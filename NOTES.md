# Notes

These notes are not formal design docs. They are random notes to track the development process and help me to not forget what I was doing.

## ToDo

* Develop a widget that can do candlestick and line graphs on the same canvas. Test it. (requires the matplotlib library)
  * Allow different length data sets with horizontal scroll bars.
* Build the user interface with stubbed out menus. UI will use the notebooks and SQL interface from the Accounting app.
* Implement the logic to read the status of a stock from the internet. (requires the pandas library)
* Include the logic to pick one and/or retrieve the lists from the internet.  (there are 100's of stocks)
* Begin to implement the individual indicator strategies as graph entries. Allow more than one to be displayed.
* Allow specific data sets to be stored in the database.
  * Store analysis scenarios in the database.
* Allow automatic scheduled updating of the database from the internet.
* Create a daemon that can run the rules without the UI and send email alerts.

## Done

* This file. :) 

## Questions

* Why does bacon taste so good?
